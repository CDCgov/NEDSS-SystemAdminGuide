## Implementation
GitHub Pages hosts System Admin Guide site by serving static HTML, CSS, and JS directly from this repository (via GitHub Actions) .

Just the Docs is a Jekyll-based theme optimized for documentation sites, fully-compatible with GitHub Pagesâ€”providing menus, search, collections, and theming out-of-the-box .

GitHub Actions Workflow builds and deploys content through these steps:

- Build main branch into _site/. from docs directory and separately _guide_preview
- Discover and build any release-* branches into _previous_versions/<branch>/.
- Upload and deploy everything via GitHub Pages.
- Jekyll renders navigation, hides preview docs, and adds version management.


## Draft & Preview Content

You can drop Markdown files into the `_guide_preview/` directory to serve **draft or preview documentation** that is:
- **Rendered and available**, but **hidden from navigation and search**.
- Accessible **only** via direct URL (e.g. `/guide_preview/my-file/`).


## Previous Versions
Branches starting with release- are automatically built and deployed under `/previous_versions/<branch>/` via GitHub Actions.


## Markdown & Configuration Sources
We use GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) for tables, fenced code blocks, lists, etc.

Just the Docs theme renders pages according to _config.yml, supporting navigation, collections, syntax highlighting, and more .



## Building and Previewing Site locally

Assuming Jekyll and Bundler are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.
2.  Run `bundle install`.
3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`. The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
